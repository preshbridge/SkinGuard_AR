# SkinGuard AR
An AR mobile application for skin health education in Nigeria

 Overview
SkinGuard AR is an educational mobile application that uses simulated augmented reality to raise awareness about common skin conditions—acne, rashes, and stretch marks. Designed for young adults in regions, it delivers evidence-based prevention tips and promotes proactive skin care, without claiming to diagnose.

Aligned with UN Global Challenge #3 (Healthcare), SkinGuard AR addresses gaps in dermatological access through a mobile-first, culturally aware design.
